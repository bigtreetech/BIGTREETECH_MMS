[mms swap]
# Enable/disable the swap module
# 0 = disable, 1 = enable
# When disabled, all filament mms swap operations will be skipped

# Filament Swap Command Configuration
# --------
# Command string used for filament slot selection
# For example, with a 4-slot system:
# "T" ==> "T0" to "T3" where "T0" means "swap current filament to slot 0"
command_string: T

# --------
# Safe Mode Settings
# --------
# Enable/disable safe mode for toolhead movements
# 0 = disabled, 1 = enabled
# When enabled, inserts M400 (wait for move completion) after each G1 movement
# This slows down operations but increases safety by ensuring moves complete
safe_mode: 0
